# StitchModes enum
Defines the mechanism used to offset sub-images when generating a full page image by stitching together multiple sub-images. 
If the width or height of a page being checked is larger than the viewport, and the entire page is being checked, then the full page image is generated by capturing multiple sub-images on the page at different offsets and stitching these image together. This enumerated value is used to define the type of mechanism to be used to offset the image before capturing each sub-image. In general, use of [CSS](#) is recommended, although the default is [Scroll](#). On pages with complex CSS or scrolling, if one method causes issues, then using the other method may avoid them. 
###### - Scroll 
 Uses standard JavaScript window scrolling. 
 ###### - CSS 
 Uses CSS to offset within the page.
