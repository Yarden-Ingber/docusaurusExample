# TextRegionSettings class
An object of this type is used to pass options to [Eyes.extract\_text\_regions](./eyes#extracttextregions-method).
This feature is experimental. Please note that the functionality and/or API may change.

Typically you call the class constructor, and then call the methods of this class chained in a Fluent API style to set the required options.

For more information see [Eyes OCR support](https://applitools.com/docs/features/ocr.html) .
