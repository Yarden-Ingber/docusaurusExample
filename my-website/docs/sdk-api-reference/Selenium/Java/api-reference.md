| `BatchInfo` | `addProperty(name, value)` | Associate a user-defined property with the batch.<br />A batch property is a user-defined name/value pair that you can associate with a batch. Use the Test Manger to view the properties and their values for a particular batch and you can filter for batches with specific property values. See [Using user defined batch properties](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/working-with-test-batches/using-batch-properties.html) for more information.<br /><br />Call this method after creating the BatchInfo object and before using the Eyes.setBatch or Configuration.setBatch method to associate the batch with the test (before the test is started).<br />Set multiple properties by calling BatchInfo.addProperty multiple times with the same property name and different values.<br />You should not assign a given value to a property more than once in a given batch run. | name<br />Type: `String`<br />The name of the property.<br /><br />value<br />Type: `String`<br />The value to be associated with this property. | Type: `BatchInfo` |

Each entry in the list is a single name/value pair.
| `BatchInfo` | `getSequenceName()` | Use this method to retrieve the batch sequence name for a batch.<br /><br />A batch sequence name can be associated with one or more batches. You can then view status and statistical information regarding the batches associated with the sequence name. If the sequence name is not provided explicitly, then the value of the environment variable APPLITOOLS_BATCH_SEQUENCE is used, if it is defined. Otherwise, the sequence name is undefined and Insight statistics are not available. For more details see [Insights batch statistics](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/test-manager/pages/page-insights/tm-page-insights-batches.html). | | Type: `String` |
| `BatchInfo` | `getStartedAt()` | Use this method to retrieve the date and time that will be displayed in the Test Manager as the start time of the batch. | | Type: `Calendar` |

| `BatchInfo` | `setId(id)` | Use this method to set the unique id of the batch.<br />You need to set the id explicitly if you want to batch tests that are run at different times or in different platforms or processes. For more information see [Batching tests in a distributed environment](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/working-with-test-batches/batching-tests-in-a-distributed-environment.html).<br /><br />If the id is not set, and the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_BATCH_ID` is defined, then its value will be used as the id. If the environment variable is not defined, then an internal unique id will be generated and used. Since this value is unique for each test run, if you don't set the id explicitly you can only batch tests that run in the current test run.  | id<br />Type: `String`<br />The unique id of the batch. If not passed, or passed as null, and the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_BATCH_ID` is defined, then the value of the environment variable will be used as the id. If the environment variable is not defined then a unique internal id will be generated and used. | | |
| `BatchInfo` | `setNotifyOnCompletion(notifyOnCompletion)` | Enable informing the Eyes server that the batch has completed.<br /><br />This is part of the Batch completion notification feature. The fact that a test run reports completion to the Eyes server does not mean that a batch completion notification is actually sent to users. Actual batch completion notication depends on how the feature has been configured by the Test Manager administrator. In particular, the configuration must either specify the application name of the test that should be notified or the configuration must be set so that all applications are notified. For more details see [Batch completion notification](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/sdk/setup-batch-completion-notification-sdk.html). | notifyOnCompletion<br />Type: `boolean`<br />If this value is true then a notification will be sent. | |

| `BatchInfo` | `eyes.setBatch(new BatchInfo(name)`<br />`.withBatchId('myId');` | Use this method to set the unique id of the batch using a Fluent interface.<br />You need to set the id explicitly if you want to batch tests that are run at different times or in different platforms or processes. For more information see [Batching tests in a distributed environment](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/working-with-test-batches/batching-tests-in-a-distributed-environment.html)<br /><br />This command is intended for use instead of the setId method. It can be called as part of the constructor of the Batchinfo object as shown in the syntax section. | id<br />Type: `String`<br />The unique id of the batch. If not passed, or passed as null, and the environment variable APPLITOOLS_BATCH_ID is defined, then the value of the environment variable will be used as the id. If the environment variable is not defined then a unique internal id will be generated and used. | Type: `BatchInfo` |
| `ChromeEmulationInfo` | | Objects of this class are used to configure the Ultrafast Grid to render checkpoints by emulating a device by using Chrome mobile emulation. | | |
| `ChromeEmulationInfo` | `ChromeEmulationInfo(deviceName, screenOrientation)` | Create an object that can be used to configure the Ultrafast Grid to render checkpoints by emulating a device using Chrome mobile emulation.<br />Pass an instances of this class to addBrowser in order to configure the mobile device defined by the parameters to the method. | deviceName<br />Type: `DeviceName`<br />The name of the device, a value from the set of devices defined by DeviceName.<br /><br />screenOrientation<br />Type: `ScreenOrientation`<br />If the device should be rendered in portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) orientation. | Type: `ChromeEmulationInfo` |

| `ClassicRunner` | `ClassicRunner()` | The constructor for the ClassicRunner class.<br />An object of this class is used to manage multiple Eyes sessions when working without the Ultrafast Grid. Pass this object to each instantiation of the Eyes constructor. Wait for the results of all the instances using ClassicRunner.getAllTestResults | | Type: `ClassicRunner` |
| `ClassicRunner` | `getAllTestResults()`<br/><br/>`getAllTestResults(shouldThrowException)` | Call this method to get the test results for all the tests that were run using this runner.<br/>The method must be called after all the tests executing on the runner have been closed by calling Eyes.closeAsync or Eyes.abortAsync | shouldThrowException<br/>Type: `boolean`<br/>If a value of true is passed and any test did not pass, or there was a failure, then an exception is thrown. If a value of false is passed, then the object returned contains the test results and status of all the tests. The calling program should use the TestResultContainer.getException method to examine the exception status and, if it is null, check the various methods in the TestResults returned by the method getTestResults to see if the tests passed or mismatched where found. If no parameter is passed, then the default value is true. | Type: `TestResultsSummary` |

| `Configuration` | | This class is used to create a configuration object that is used to configure an `Eyes` object by passing it to the `Eyes.setConfiguration` method.<br/>You can use this configuration object instead of using the various `Eyes` methods and properties that set the same attributes. Typically you set up a Configuration object by calling its setXXXX methods chained with a '.' in a Fluent coding style. | | |
| `Configuration` | `Configuration()` | The constructor for the `Configuration` class. This object isset upand then passed to the `Eyes.setConfiguration` method before the call to the `Eyes.open` method. | | Type: `Configuration`<br/>The value returned is the object that called the method. This allows you to use a fluent style to call the set `XXXX` methods of the Configuration class. |
| `Configuration` | `config.addBrowser(desktopBrowserInfo)`<br/><br/>`config.addBrowser(chromeEmulationInfo)`<br/><br/>`config.addBrowser(iosDeviceInfo)`<br/><br/>`config.addBrowser(width, height, browserType, baselineEnvName)`<br/><br/>`config.addBrowser(width, height, browserType)` | [Full description](./detailed-explanations/add-browser-explanations)
